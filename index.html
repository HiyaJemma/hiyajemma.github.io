<br> <br> this little webpage is here to give you a bit of info about me, and linktree to other stuff
<br> <br> - my name's Jemma, I live in california somewhere perhaps. Born on July 3rd, 2006.
<br> <br> - my pronouns are she/any <a href="https://en.pronouns.page/@HiyaJemma">(my pronouns page)</a>, most girl blue cube you've ever seen but she doesn't mind being called other things. gender norms are fucked though
<br> <br> - I'm diagnosed with aspergers (on the autistic spectrum), meaning you're gonna get a lotta rambling sometimes. I kinda need a minute or two to think about stuff as I'm saying it, will flub a lot of what I say when talking. I try my best to express how I feel about subjects, even when they aren't really relevant to much. Thought experiments are a lot of fun and I tend to drone on about those a bit too.
<br> <br> - controversial take I think people are cool. gay people, black people, neurodivergent people, firefighters, people in general I think. Wouldn't exactly call it being progressive or woke or a liberal per se, I think it's basic respect to recognize that people live different lives than you do sometimes, and I try to live with that in mind.
<br> <br> - with that being said I'm gay <br><br>

<h1><b>Hobbies:</b></h1>
<p> - I like talking and thinking about game development, my <a href="https://backloggery.com/HiyaJemma">backloggery page</a> is where I discuss and talk about games I've played, and track my backlog in general.
<br> I wanna work in game development as a career, and I have a lot of particular ideas for games to make.
<br> In general though, besides the game development, I also just play video games a lot in general. 
<br><br> - I mentioned a blurb about how I ramble a lot earlier, but really, I ramble a *lot*. If you strike a fun conversation with me, I'll see it through. Debating philosophy and morality are my absolute jam. I think a lot about a lot of things. Just be sure to not be trolling or something. My discord is <a href="https://discordapp.com/users/538767789674987550/">hiyajemma</a> feel free to hit me up for fun stuff
<br><br> - I also draw in my free time a lot, when I'm feeling bored and wanna watch some youtube idly in the background for a few hours. I like bundling up in bed and drawing on my dinky phone and getting better at it over time. 
<br> I post a lot of my art on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hiyajemma.bsky.social">bluesky</a>, feel free to follow me there for that sorta thing
<br><br> - once in a blue moon I like editing videos here and there, I post on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HiyaJemma">youtube channel</a> when I have something to upload. I have a few ongoing projects here and there I want to dedicate time to, but it's nothing too big usually
<br><br> - I've put a lot of time into geometry dash specifically, I know the ins and outs of the editor, I know how the game works top to bottom, and I have <a href="https://gdbrowser.com/u/hiyajemma">a lot to show for it</a>. It's generally contributed to some sorta coding knowledge, but it's the most pathetic kind of coding to have a solid grasp on tbh. I may or may not create stuff on there when I feel like it, but I'm not entirely sure on that as much anymore.
<br><br> - Only music I've really listened to as of late (outside of game OSTs) is <a href="https://youtu.be/T4t1vYNY0mA">glass beach</a>. Really damn good stuff, highly recommend. <br><br>
